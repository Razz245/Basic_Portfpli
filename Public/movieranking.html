    <h2>The Best Movie According To Razz Sharms</h2>
    <h3>Screen Rant compiled a list of the best movies of all time, based on critical scores and audience opinions.
        The list includes a diverse range of films, from classic dramas like The Grapes of Wrath to animated favorites like Ratatouille .
        These movies are highly acclaimed for their storytelling, performances, and significant contributions to cinema history.<br>
       <b>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</b></h3>
       
    
       <h3>Here are the Best Movies of all time, as evaluated by Screen Rant. Covering Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth to Alfred Hitchcock’s classic thriller Rear Window, with cartoon rats, gangsters and superheroes in between, it’s the perfect list for emerging cinephiles or checking off essential watches.
       
       Deciding the best movies ever takes a balance of objective and subjective preference, which can differ for industry professionals and general viewers. Something as important as the greatest movies of all time requires some advanced thinking, beyond the opinion of a single writer. With that in mind, Screen Rant's ranking collates critical scores and the opinions of movie lovers to compile the definitive list of the most highly rated movies of all time.</h3>
       
       <b>How We Worked It Out</b>
       
       <h3>We took the top 250 movies on IMDb and Metacritic and assigned each movie a score based on the range of scores in the dataset. These equally weighted scores were summed and then standardized into our own Screen Rant score. The result is a scoring system that equally and fairly honors both the audience and critic voice, leading to a list that runs the full length of cinema history.</h3>
